# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

### *I will encourage others in the spirit of* pay it forward.

#### Start Date
First Day, June 23rd of Sixth Month, 2024.

## Additional Rules
1. I will post about my progress every day. I will announce my commitment on: LinkedIn, fCC's Discord Channel and to the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Club. On each of these I will post a link daily to the log which will initially be a file in this GitHub [GH] repo.
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. The log will initially be a file [this, log.md] in this 100 Days repo. I intend that by the end of this 100 days I will migrate the log to a blog that will be part of my profile site.
6. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
7. As I progress through the 100 days I will refine my intentions, my goals and my presentation,
8. The hosting location will initially be GitHub Pages [GHP]. I anticipate this will change to a hosting solution such as Netlify or Render by the end of the 100 days.
9. I commit to connecting with others in line with point four of README.MD by the end of Week One.


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/)
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
5. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
