# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 001/100: Seventh Day, 28th of Ninth Month, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Work on Codecademy Challenge Project Website Design System

**Thoughts:** From Day One of Round One: 'It feels good to be starting this for real at last.'

It feels even better to be starting Round One.

**Link to work:** [(https://github.com/mcnairsa/CD-Design-System/]

Notes:
After spending some time on putting together an index.html from scratch I found that I had already made a previous start on this. Today's effort is saved as ideas.html. It has some useful thoughts on how I hope to approach this project but is over-ambitions.

Plan for tomorrow:
1. Expand index.html (the original one)
2. Create the CSS
3. Make a plan for the next few projects

I aim to complete the Website Design System project by the end of tomorrow's project work time. It will be quite basic but will meet the requirements set out by Codecademy for the project so I can sign it off and move on.

### Day 002/100: 29-09-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed Animal Fun Facts. With the help of the AI.
It's been a while since I worked on it and I've forgottem most of what it was about

**Thoughts:** 
This feels a lot more solid than Round 0. Quite a lot to do to tidy up the noise and clutter.
Important that I get on top of the learning and memory aspects of this. Especially things like the webpage meta data.

**Link to Work:**
No link as it was on the Cc 

**Pay Forward:**
Cc Circle: Sea 
LinkedIn: Someone who made a 'Frogger' type game - in Python, I think. I looked for it again to record it here and can't find it.


### Day 003/100: 30-09-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Downloaded the 'starting' files for Codecademy's Challenge Project Find Your Hat. Set up local and remote repo for the same.
In the process of which I set up templates for repo README.md files and the LICENSE (sic) files.

**Thoughts:** 
This isn't much of a start and is a departure from what I was planning to do. However, if feels more solid 

**Link to Work:**
https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat
Not much to see yet except for the Codecademy starting code, more to come.

**Pay Forward:**
1. Reply to reply from 'Sea' on Cc's Circle
2. Aditi Byhut on Linked in - 86/100 'Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings'.

**Notes:**
1. In my mind the 100 days falls into two halves of seven weeks each of seven weeks plus two days. My week starts on a 1st Day/Sunday so the 100-day round starts on a 7th Day/Saturday (I started on 28th of the 9th Month/September). This gives me a day of easing myself into the 100 days at the beginning and a day of easing myself out at the end. To help me along I plan to give the weeks a focus. (See below, points (2) & (3).

2. In parallel with the 100 days of coding I am also re-treading the path through Stephen R. Covey's <<Seven Habits of Highly Effective People>>. Each week of the first seven I will focus on one of the 'Habits' This week it is Habit One: Be Proactive. (I may also cycle through the 7 habits, or at least the first 6, on each day of the week. 

3. Possibly in weeks 8 to 14 I will use the book <<7 Languages in 7 Weeks>> as my focus tool. That remains to be seen.


### Day 004/100: 01-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed the Codecademy 'Find Your Hat challenge project

**Thoughts:** 
First time in a long while doing any coding that was more than simply obeying orders to follow a 'project' point by point. Some what. Frustrating how much I had to look up and go back over the relevant lessons but felt good nonetheless.

[Proposal/Plan for the next day

**Link to Work:**
main.js now updated with some of my own work:

https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat

**Intention and expectation for the next day**
Tomorrow, in the spirit of 'Start with the end in mind' (today's 'Habit') I aim to make significant progress with this project if not complete it.

**Pay Forward:**

2. @spsinghrathore on Codecademy


### Day 005/100: 02-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed the Find Your Hat game. I have the main game loop in place.

**Thoughts:** 
Moving slowly and taking one step at a time is working. As I come across any aspect of JS that I'm not sure of I am going back to the Codecademy lessons and as a minimum using the practice facility as a refresher.

**Link to Work:**

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Tomorrow I aim to complete this project at least to the minimum specification given.

### Day 006/100: 03-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
More of a thinking about sort of a day than a coding day.

**Thoughts:** 
Today I find that if I call it programming rather than coding it makes me feel better.

**Link to Work:**
Noting committed today, see above

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Tomorrow I hope to have more focus

I can identify with what you say  

Although I’ve studied the material before in going through the F-S path I’ve not really grasped it. I find that the F-SE modules and he whole of F-SE can be overwhelming. Recently I’ve started searching for the individual courses. Each one has a certificate of achievement and each is only expected to take 3 or 4 hours. That’s with the quiz and the end of lesson project. 

Also it helps me to use the quizzes as a learning resource. I go back over them. If I get less than 100% consistently I use the practice sessions until I feel I have grokked it. 

The most important skill in learning anything is learning how to learn. There’s a useful resource here

Go well

2.To @Rea on fCC'd Discord 100-Days-of-Code channel
Good luck with the journey @Rea

It looks like you're taking very full notes there. I've alwasys had a difficult relationship with note-taking. I'm interested to know what you do with them, how they help you learn.

Bonus: https://community.codecademy.com/u/525664b8 
Anyone interested in build a world changing product? I need data science, Back End,and A.I work? I’m a UX designer so I can handle product direction, UX, and business strategy.

My Post:
Interesting.	

Would you like to share information about your product? In what way will it change the world? How will it make the world a better place for us and future generations?


### Day 007/100: 04-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
I did a small amount of project work but didn't commit anything.
I intended to do more but fell asleep at the wheel so gave up.

**Thoughts:** 
Doing the pay forward is what matters to me most. I put my thoughts in writing and may record them (in summary, the original isn't in an appropriate form for sharing atm) here later.

**Link to Work:**
Nothing commited

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Fail better...


### Day 008/100: 05-10-2025

**Today's Progress**:
Progressed the Find Your Hat Codecademy project

Note: not that I expect anybody to be looking at it but I muffed up the days on the commit messages.

On checking in with the AI (on the Codecademy learning environment) I got this:
It looks like you’re experiencing an ENXIO error, which typically means that the program is trying to access a device that’s unavailable, in this case, /dev/tty. This often occurs in environments where standard input/output is not available, such as certain online coding platforms or during tests. To fix this, you can replace the prompt implementation with a mock input or testing framework suitable for the environment you’re using, or simulate user input in your tests.

Here’s how you can fix line 40 by using a placeholder for user input:

... It looks to me like it's time to take this off-platform.

**Link to Work:**
The changes aren't great but here's the link nonetheless
https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Start working on this locally. I'll still use the Codecademy learning environment because of the feedback I can get from the AI but it feels like time to get a bit more independent of it.


### Day 009/100: 06-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed the Codecademy Find Your Hat challenge project. Not a lot just a little. I have realised that the code needs to be restructured. The game loop should be a method of the class. Mainly I was making minor adjustments. 


**Thoughts:**
This works much better on the local environment than on the platform.

**Link to Work:**
https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat/main.js

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
I now have a better perspective on the Find Your Hat project. I hope to finish it tomorrow.

What to do next
As the title suggest, I'm not to sure what to do next. I'm about to finish the Python 3 course and not sure what to choose next. Do I go for a career path like Full Stack? Or go for an individual language like Java, JavaScript, C# or Swift?


What are you doing this for? Are you hoping to make a career out of it or do you just want to learn as much about IT as possible? In what follows I’ll assume it’s the former.

tl;dr

If you know what you want to achieve google a bit to find the path to that goal and follow it.
If you don’t know, play around with what’s on offer on Codecademy and see what you feel drawn to.

From my previous experience working in IT I would say you are better off extending your knowledge of Python. A successful IT career depends on the right balance of breadth and depth. Breadth is measured in how many languages you know e.g. ‘C’, C++, C#, Java and similar languages or frameworks e.g. React, Vue, Angular. Depth is measured in how well you know any one language or framework. People get more respect for depth of knowledge. Doing 5 introductory courses means you know how to write a for loop or create a class 5 different ways but can’t do much with any language. Doing the next level course (in your case Python?) means you have more to offer.

IT careers are built on skill sets. A skill set usually includes knowledge of a programming language but includes more besides. Most commercial applications use some kind of database. It often includes knowledge of an ‘industry’ like marketing, manufacture, insurance or healthcare. It also often includes specific packages that cater for the needs of those industries. Or if you want to go into, for example Data Science, you would need to be well-versed in libraries that have that focus.

As you’re asking this question I guess you don’t have that kind of focus yet. Taking a breadth-first approach may be more appropriate to you right now. If that’s the case I suggest you try the other languages.

One thing that will stand you in good stead is to actually know how to use your computer. The Codecademy learning environment is great, it’s safe and (usually) comfortable but it’s an unreal world. Learn the command line and how to navigate the file system. Learn to use an editor. Learn how to test the stuff you write for yourself.

And make sure you properly learn stuff. For example, the first 5 to 10 lines or so of a webpage from <head> to </head> are stuff that no web developer is ever likely to write on the job. It’s boilerplate that will come from a template or be generated for you. If I were interviewing though l’d pick the persons who can walk up to the whiteboard and write that stuff without thinking over the one who hasn’t bothered to learn it. To give another example, can that person tell me straight off how the Big O notation works on a simple search vs a binary search. If not why not. Confession time: I couldn’t. That’s why I’m sat in bed typing this rather than being paid to do something I enjoy. It’s also why IT and I parted company over years ago.

Sorry turned into a rant aimed mainly at myself…

Awesome! Thank you:-)

Time taken: approx 1.5 hrs and only one

### Day 010/100: 07-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
More on Find Your Hat. I took a step back, read the rubric properly and re-organised my main game loop into a method of its own. I intended to come back to it but life and family got in the way.
I have also moved off-platform.

**Thoughts:** 
Feels good to have a better grip on the program. Being off-platform feels a lot more grown up. In the back-ground I am working back over some of the concepts in <<The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People>> The first three habits relate to moving from dependence [in this case on the hand-holding of having the learning platform] to independence. Independence is not a goal in itself but a necessary step in the direction of interdependence. Which is what we're all about here, right?

OP: Day 12 in Full-Stack Development: Web App For Asking My Crush Out
Posted: 07-10-2024

I wanted to take a moment to share my learning experience and a fun project I recently completed. While I couldn’t finish the full Codecademy Full Stack Developer course due to financial constraints, I made some amazing progress on my journey as an aspiring developer.

One of my proudest achievements so far is a web application I built to ask my crush out on a date! ...

My response

Awesome idea. Glad to hear it did the trick too:-)

How are you carrying on with the Full-Stack journey if you can't continue on Codecademy? Have you found freeCodeCamp.org's curriculum? Or The Odin Project? I recently discovered that IBM have a Full-Stack Engineer Certification as well and I think that may be free. Also (sorry Codecademy Sales:-) you can do quite a lot of F-SE for free if you take the individual courses.

That's a really comprehensive README.md, btw. It puts any and all of mine to shame!

### Day 011/100: 08-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed Find Your Hat. More work on the game engine.

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed Codecademy off-platform pjoject Tea Cozy
Involves doing battle with Flexbox which I haven't looked at in mohths. Pretty rusty on CSS in general tbh.
Got back into that headspace and made progress with the contacts and footer sections.


**Thoughts:** 
This is a project that folks on the Full-Stack group on Codecademy were asking for help with. I feels like I might be able to shed some light on it for people who are still in the fog.

1. @Paul... on Cc's Circle
Responding to Intro and '1961' + ZX81 experience
Me: Hey   !

You beat me by one model. My first was the ZXSpectrum. I dabbled in various languages. Basic, Pascal, C, possibly Fortran and Lisp and managed to learn zero programming from any of it. My crowning achievement was to set the text colour to black before I’d thought to set the background colour to something other than black … oops! I think I pulled the plug and vowed never to do anything quite so idiotic ever again. A vow soon broken, no doubt.

Keep it up.

If I were to give advice to anyone starting out on this path, I would say:

1. think about the time you can commit to this

2. think about how long you want to give it before you feel you have got to where you have enough confidence and independence to be able to make your own self-directed projects

3. … and then find a path that will get you there in your timeframe.

Full-Stack may be what you want if you have the time and want a well-rounded level of knowledge. Or you might want to focus in on either Front-End or Back-End. The front-end is great for design and making pretty things. Back-End is more pointy-headed. There’s pleny of scope in both for point-headedness and prettiness though.

There again maybe Python, Data Science  and all things Data is your thing.

Not sure if you were asking for advice but you got it anyway, my Bad!

Go well!

btw:  I have seniority over you in years if not in tech, 1958 here
PPS: If you’re into Data look at MongoDB. You may have already but you didn’t mention it.

### Day 014/100: 11-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed Find Your Hat: Working on the .generateField() method to create a game field from given prameters


**Thoughts:** 
Tired so I'm heading to bed now. Would have like to do more but there you go.
I wasn't too sure how to poplulate the 2d array but found a really useful article. (Linked to in the code.)
Catching up to where I wanted to be with New Amsterdam felt good but doing more coding might have felt a whole lot better.

### Day 015/100: 12-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
A learning day. Did some more C# on Codecademy.


**Thoughts:** 
If I'm truly honest today was a near 100Days disaster. I did over an hour of learning so I'm letting it count as a day not missed.

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Before I do anything else I am going to play the day. I shall plan what I intend to work on, how long I will give to each task and what I expect to achieve for each task. At the end of the day (i.e. tea-time not a late bed-time) I shall assess how realistic my expectations were.

re: Day 2 and how to remember stuff.
Me: Well done for embarking on the challenge @Ajay Yadav I really hope it helps take your coding forward.

As for helping to make things stick. If you have the time - or are willing to make time - investigate ‘spaced repetition’ and the Leitner box system. To make the most of your Codecademy time try going over the quizzes in the lessons. Most lessons will offer you a structured practice session. I find the quizzes work well in identifying what it is I haven’t understood.

For example, I have sturggled with the CSS position property values and particularly ‘relative’ and ‘absolute’. Mainly because it seems to me they are both relative to something and I could never remember which was which. I did the quiz again (I finished that module ages ago) and now I’ve finally got it ‘fixed’ (pun semi-intentional) in my head.

Good luck!

### Day 016/100: 13-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Another learning day. More C# on Codecademy.


**Thoughts:** 
I'm OK with today being a learning day. I also set up a new TV that involved significant re-organisation of furniture. It's bigger than the previous one by quite a margin.

Too long ago to remember what if anything specific  got me into IT. Iwas drawn to it like a moth to a candle flame and have been burning my wings off over and over ever since.


### Day 017/100: 14-10-2024

### Day 021/100: 18-10-2024
**Today's Progress**:
Posting this now so that I don't forget or fall asleep before I've done it. I will continue after.
Progressed project: Build a Website Design System [Codecademy] -> Full-Stack Engineer -> Part 1 -> Improved Styling with CSS ...

+Update+
I used the GitHub cli for the first time to create a repo from the command line on my local machine. It's super-easy and imo the obvious way to work.d

**Thoughts:**
This project and I have an interesting history. Most of the work I've done today has been to make sense of the ideas I've had about it over the months, and probably years. In that time I accumulated a bunch of thoughts about principles of design (accessibility, process, lots of stuff that has nothing to do with the project spec) and have a bundle of notes and abandoned index.htmls spread across several directories and GH repos. I'm now coming back to earth and landing on a solid intention to get this one done and put to bed.

re: SSG project on Boot.dev
me:  Thank you SOoo much for sharing this. Just had a quick look. They had me at 'avoid tutorial hell'! Some years ago I tried to write a site generator in Java. I knew no Java (worked through some chapters of 'Head First Java', 1st edition to try to make sense of it) and got precisely nowhere. End of my short-lived career as a web dev. Will be tracking down the course you're following in the next few days. Thanks again and more power to your 'flying' finger tips.

**Today's Progress**: 
Made some progress with the [Codecademy] C# course on my Traineeship

### Day 028/100: 25-10-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
More study with Codecademy. A little bit further with both Java and C#.


**Thoughts:** 
I've been listening to the audio book version of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. [Hereinafter '7H' & 'SRC'.]  I first studied it some years ago. It was my intention to use the first half of this 100 Days to Refresh my understanding of the book. I thought I could do that just by focusing on one of the habits each week but it didn't happen. I came across the audio book a week ago. In the chapter on Habit 2, Begin with the End in Mind, SRC has a section on Personal Mission Statements. I remember it well, it made a big impression the first time I read it. One thing in particular jumped out at me from one of the examples SRC gives: 'Plan tomorrow's work today'.

So here's my list of tomorrow's [100 Days related] work:
1. pay forward to at least two learners
2. complete 1 hour's concentrated study in Codecademy's Introduction to Java
3. complete 1 hour's concentrated study in Codecademy's Introduction to C#

2. @ Lerius on fCC's Discord

### Day 029/100: 27-10-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Revised Cc lesson on GitHub collaboration


**Thoughts:**
I'm looking at setting up a repo to collaborate with fellow students on an index of projects across multiple Codecademy courses and paths. Not sure if this has legs at this time but thinking about it is a useful exercise.
Still sort of hazy about this. Will have to practice on it to get my head round it.

### Day 033/100: 31-10-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Completed ... tracking down tutorials and code examples pertinent to my Cc Portfolio and Design System Challenge Projects


**Thoughts:** 
Last two days my 100-days-ish time has been mostly about converting a pile of tab groups to bookmarks and tracking down stuff that I want to reference or take inspiration from. This has been frustrating but it will pay out in the long run. The last piece of my present/most recent empuzzlement was a Stack Exchange piece about the CSS colour (sic) equivalents to the green and amber on black monitors we used back in the day.

1.  @ Martease on Cc Circle
re: I’m trying to figure out the best way to kick off my freelancing journey. What steps should I take? Who should I connect with or learn from? Also, what do you think of “Blue Collar Dev” as a name for my development company?
me:
Hi Martease
Good to hear from you
A few thoughts in response to your post...

**Me**
My background is a mix of white collar and blue collar. I worked most recently on the shop floor in an office furniture factory. Previously I worked as: bus driver, warden of a Quaker  meetinghouse, ESOL teacher and all sorts of agency jobs. I'm not myself drawn to freelance or start-up so maybe this is an objective viewpoint or maybe it's well wide of the mark. I also worked for 10 years as a computer programmer. (Ref: my Codecademy & GitHub profile biogs)

**Refactor life one section at a time**
It sounds like you want to make some big changes. Are you looking for a clean break from everything that's gone before? If not then maybe take things one step at a time. Would you consider getting a 9 to 5 in IT to build up your skills? Could you get web/computer-related work with your current employer if you're still in work? Where I last worked we were always waiting on one or other of two people to be available to get any changes made to our IT systems. If your place is the same then maybe you can offer to ease the pressure. If you have spare time outside work offer to use that time. It'll help your cv/resume. Don't let them take the Mick though. Your time and sanity is worth more to you than the experience. If you're not in work then try reaching out to contacts you may have through your previous job(s).

**Build on existing strengths**
The big thing in IT is 'skill-set' and a skill-set includes domain/industry specific knowledge. A 'useful engine' is someone who has  knowledge of an industry (in IT terms 'industry' includes things like banking, insurance, hospitality, retail). Look to capitalise on your non-IT skills as well as any IT-specific skills you gain.

**Depth 1st, then breadth**
You're starting with front-end. When you get the back-end knowledge as well see what you're drawn to. Whichever direction you find yourself going try to get as much understanding of what lies behind any tools & frameworks that you use (e.g. Bootstrap, jQuery, React &c). Something like Bootstrap may mean you can style pages faster but the more secure your knowledge of the basics of CSS the better you will use the tool. Freelance or being the boss means being a generalist but knowing a bit of lots won't help you or your clients. And if you end up with a team of people working for you and you don't understand what they're doing then things may not end well.
  
**Want to be an employer? Be Kind!**
Choose good people to work with and treat them well. It won't always work out the way you hope. The more you effort you put into the people side of your business the more likely you are to succeed. If in the end it doesn't work for you, be content with working for yourself.

**... and finally**
Invest in yourself as a whole not just your IT skills. Consider something like Stephen Covey's '7 Habits of Highly Effective People'

btw: 'Blue Collar Dev' sounds great if it works for you.

re: [Which point in the (Google/Android Developer programme) they are up to]
me: Over 3/4 of the way to 100 Days... Well done keep it up!. Are you enjoying Android development?

**Notes 4 Leitner:**
CSS Position esp 'Relative' & 'Absolute'
Note: the first time I did this (yesterday, being 04-11-2024) I used relative. I got it positioned
body {
  background-color: #FFF;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.container {
  background-color: #91f2d2;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
}

.box {
  height: 50px;
  width: 50px;
}

.black-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 150px;
  background-color: black;
}

.blue-box {
  position: absolute;
  left: 250px;
  background-color: #2d5dcc;
}

### Day 039/100: 05-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Much practice on Codecademy practice sessions. Mainly CSS.


**Thoughts:** 
I find the CSS position property confusing as. 'relative' and 'absolute' trip me up everytime a coconut. I may have got it now. 'relative' is 'relative' to its natural position if there were no explicit positioning. 'absolute' is [relative] to its nearest positioned ancestor' or something like that. Problem was that the elements in question have no positioned ancestor. I which case I guess they are positioned relative (but it's called absolute) to the root element or the page itself. Something like that.


**Link to Work:**
n/a [yet but I'll be up for a while longer so that may change]

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Try to have a constructive and well thought out day
[Edit: ... - 25:08hrs]
(Something I thought of earlier, might have done but spent time on the 'Advanced Grid' lesson instead)
Use a(n HTML) table to show the research sites
Add a Comment column or Pro/Con columns
In the footer state what's being taken from each to make up the final style/layout
[Remember to simplicate and add as much lightness as possible.]

Notes: CSS Grid - is there a 'justify-existence' property?
Perhaps justify-self comes close?

### Day 040/100: 07-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Spent time on practice sessions for CSS Flexbox and Grid. Stuff is slowly sinking in.
One consequence of having been through Full-Stack several times is that I have several repos with different versions of, e.g. the Codecademy Build-a-Website-Design-System. I've spent time today making sense as best I can and rationalising my repos. Not the best use of time but hey ho!

### Day 044(I think)/100: 11-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Organising a schedule for completion of my traineeship


**Thoughts:** 
Thinking about how much I have to cover for this traineeship and it's scary. I have Full-Stack, Bootstrap (CSS) jQuery plus the intro courses for Python, PHP, C#, and Java. More significant though, is the realisation that some sort of project that encompasses as much as possible of the material is going to really help with consolidating the learning or 'metabolising' as my son (also in IT/tech) puts it. I will be tested on all of the stuff mentioned. Problems is though that the other languages are scarcely above the Hello World level compared to Full-Stack. Not enough even had I the time and inclination to make a significant project. And I **definitely** don't have the time to take any of them to a higher level. Hmmm......

### Day 046(I think)/100: 12-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on git branching to make sense of multiple attempts at a Codecademy challenge project
Note: the git branch/merge part was way more challenging than the challenge project
Got a clearer idea of what I feel is right for a README for this level of project.


**Thoughts:**

Day out today so didn't get to do my habitual morning session.

me: Hi @maribaroni The rules say one day is OK, more is frowned upon. As the I Ching might put it: 'Consistency furthers.' Truth of the matter is 'perseverance furthers' and coming back after a break when circumstances are difficult shows determination. We do what we can. Were we perfected beings we probably wouldn't be here.



### Day 047/100: 14-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Made some more progress in understanding how the git cli works.


**Thoughts:** 
I got woken up way too early this morning and have been struggling all day to focus.


**Link to Work:**

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:
To stay awake *???*

re: Using [JS?] libraries but starting with 'fundamental JS'
me: Good scheme. I reckon it's always best to start by knowing what goes on under the bonnet ['hood'] even if you use some tool or library to speed things up later

2. @Richard Day on fCC Discord
re: Day One, wanting to build a blog to document progress
me: Well done taking the first step which is to commit to *doing something*. Have you considered that you may be trying to run before you've even investigated crawling? Perhaps  you have existing coding experience but it sounds as though you may not. Try this: (1) from the get-go make notes of what you do, that's the text for your blog. Probably easier to do it on the computer but pen and paper would work too. (2) start on the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum. It begisns with html (3) As you go make you notes into (html) web pages, one per topic. (4) When you get to CSS start prettying those pages up. Continue taking notes. Repeat steps 3 & 4 for each new technology you come to on the curriculum.
Of course if you have existing coding experience it may change the path you take but the approach will be the same.



### Day 049/100: 15-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Did my daily practice sessions on Codecademy
Trying to make sense of git branching. I'm probably not going about what I want to achieve in the right way. I think it may be an x, y problem moment.


**Thoughts:** 
Still tired not much motivation or effort:-(
I'm working on giving up caffeinated tea so have been on mostly decaf the last couple of days. I have a feeling that's what's affecting me.

me: Do you use developer tools in your browser? Firefox, Safari and Chrome all have it. You can get it to mimmick the device size/format.
Sorry I don't know where you are in your developer journey but how much have you learned about 'responsive design'? Sounds like that's what you're looking for.
Sometimes it helps to think differently about the page when you approach it from a 'mobile' frame of mind.

### Day 050/100: 16-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Revisited Codecademy git branching lesson
Reading other resources on git/GitHub.



**Thoughts:** 
I find the lack of progress frustrating.
At the same time I find the fact that I'm having to go into things in greater depth than the course suggests is good!

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**

### Day 052/100: 18-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Did my practice drill on Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer path
Completed' the Codecademy challenge project Build Your Own Cheat Sheet.


**Thoughts:** 
[Observation on how it felt ... ]


**Link to Work:**
The project isn't publicly viewable. I could make it thus but frankly it's not worth it.


**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**

**Today's Progress**: 
Did my practice session on Codecademy F-SE path
Started setting up an old laptop as a development box. More with a view to documenting the process than for any other reason.

### Day 054/100: 20-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Rather a nothing-ey sort of a day.
Was expecting to get on an online group coding session that either didn't happen or I was in the wrong place or got the times wrong or idk what.
Went to the cafe to clear my head and plan my up-coming projects but found I'd left my pen at home.
Ho hum!
I will be making a plan for tomorrow shortly. Final dog walk of the day and then off to bed with notebook and pen.

re: Finding JS made no sense and taking a step back by googling to find a site in native language.
me: !!! Hadn't realised you weren't a native English speaker. It's not the easiest language for non-native speakers. 
Good idea to take a step back and slow down the pace when you find things have stopped making sense.
Do you like cats? I just found a site called JavaScript for cats. I can't put a link here because the reply will be blocked but you can google it. It starts at a very basic level and doesn't try to teach too much, just enough. In English of course but I hope easy to follow. There's a recommended reading section too. Some may be available in languages other than English. Eloquent JavaScript is widely reckoned to be one of the best. 
Keep up the good work! 

2. @Maisie & @Xandroz on fCC Discord
re: Day One
me: Congratulations @ipms  & @_xandroz for taking the first step. Look forward to seeing your progress on here.


### Day 055/100: 21-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on a JS/React Router guided project. None of it made much sense. I've been over the lessons before but it was a while ago and frankly I'm out of my depth. I'll leave this for when I come back round to it properly on the Path.
I also reviewed the projects still to do from Parts I & II of Codecademy's Full-Stack Path.


**Thoughts:** 
I read an article on Medium) by someone who used the technique of 'blocking' time ie planning spare time in chunks to get himself into a cloud engineer job. His determination inspired me greatly.

### Day 056/100: 22-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Researched content for Codecademy challenge project: Club Website
Wireframed (loosely) page for same
Completed first module of first course of IBM Full Stack Developer Cert. Got 90% (9/10) on the first graded test.

**Thoughts:** 
The IBM thing is graded all the way and I find it very scary. The first two modules are information-intensive. I struggle with that and particularly with finding a happy medium between making 'notes' that are little less than the video transcript at one extreme and winging it with no notes at all.

Work more on the Club Website

2. @emilie on fCC Discord
re: Day 95 & stuff (don't really know what they're working on tbh)
me: Only 5 days to go! Will you carry on with your project or maybe you'll have finished it by then.


### Day 057/100: 23-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Did my practice session on Codecademy but otherwise a day off due to my cold.


**Thoughts:** 
Shame ...
Also cream crackered because completing the Coursera thing led to me not going to bed until 2am and getting only 4 hours sleep.

# Blocking
11:00 to 11:45 Practice session
finished early, about 11:35 so continued on to IBM/Coursera
Will stop this at one o'clock
Stopped at 12:08
There are a couple of supplementary exercises, I'll do those later...

### Day 059/100: 25-11-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Did my practice session
Completed two modules of the Coursera/IBM Full-Stack certification
I also carried on yesterday after I went to bed. Scores so far 90%, 70%, 100%.


**Thoughts:**
Plainly there's an aspect of resistance to continue with the traineeship stuff that's on Codecademy but for now working on the Coursera path is all I can handle. A lot of it is basic level stuff that I know from previous experience or from Codecademy


**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
I'll do what I can. I think this rotten cold is on the way out now.


**Pay Forward:**

re: 'i wanna start 100 days of code'
me: Go for it!

2. @imola on fCC Discord
re: got stuck on something, couldn't fathom why it wasn't working
me: Delete and start again often helps. I usually save the old version just in case.
I find it also helps to take the project slowly, one chunk or even one line at a time. I try to always get to the point where it's working, save that and then move on. That way I may find the thing that I haven't understood and I can go over the lesson again or google for other explanations.
Probably a good idea to choose one main platform and follow that consistently. I have a habit of hopping about and it can get me in a right mess.


### Day ???/100: 26-11-2024
**Today's Progress**:
I think I've lost track of the days, I'll get it back another time.
Did practice session.
Did pay forward.
Don't have the energy for anything else.

### Days ??? to ???
27-11-2024 to 01-12-2024
No progress on learning or coding but I maintained my streaks and, more importantly, the 'pay forward' which, to me, is a core part of the commitment I made in taking up the challenge. Perhaps the most important.

### Day ???/100: 02-12-2024
**Today's Progress**:
I managed 3/4hr on the Codecademy Build a Design System project. Set out the structure of the web page.


**Link to Work:**
n/a


**Thoughts:** 
The *Code* challenge is meant (see original article) to be about coding specifically not about work stuff and not about tutorials. It's hard to do that when you're at the stage many of us are at. We are for the most part in the early stages, fCC curriculum, Codecademy, Udemy and the like.

Next time I do this I will follow a 100-Days focused project based programme such as:
https://github.com/phillipai/100-days-of-code-python


### Day ???/100: 03-12-2024 
**Today's Progress**:
More on the Codecademy Design System project.
Working on importing fonts with the@font-face CSS rule.
Note working for me and I don't know if it's all me or if it's something to do with their learning environment so the next thing will be to try it locally. That's for tomorrow.	


**Link to Work:**
n/a


**Thoughts:**
It's tempting to jack in this round. I missed several days of anything to do with coding through not feeling well enough. I reckon that having maintained the 'pay forward' commitment I will allow myself to believe that I haven't abandoned the 100 Days commitment altogether.


1. @MD AL AMIN on fCC Discord
re: Day One
me: Hi and welcome to the challenge. Best of luck!

2. @sualokin
re: Day One

### Day ???/100: 04-12-2024
(I've lost track of the days, hope to get it sorted by the end of this week.)
**Today's Progress**:
Followed a tutorial on Digital Ocean in their 'How To Style HTML with CSS' tutorial series. Yesteday I was trying to use the @font-face rule. I read something in the tutorial about @font-face for fonts hosted on the same server as the web site. I thought you could use it with a url function and a remotely hosted font. Hope I'll have made sense of all this by the end of the tutorial.

**Link to Work:**

There are always so many ways to skin the [covers Pippin's ears] cat. But there are often subtle differences between them.

**Pay Forward:**
1.  @Corruption03 on fcc Discord
re: Day One on some ReactJS stuff and 'not best practice'.
me: Welcome to the challenge. And don't worry about best practices. That comes with time. What's important is that (1) you *know* about best practice and (2) that you *care* about best practice.

2. @LittleInksmith on fCC Discord
re: Async in JS
me: 'a little frustrating' is an understatement! Congrats if you can make any sense of it at all.

### Day ???/100: 05-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Fell down a research rabbit hole reading up about @font-face and linking fonts generally.

**Thoughts:**
Good in that I understand the territory far better now. Frustrating in that I didn't write a single line of code.

**Link to work:**
n/a

**Plan for tomorrow:**
Hope to make some real progress on the Design System Project but the next two days have significant chunks already dedicated to other stuff.

**Notes:**
Re yesterday's conumdrum: can you use the @font-face rule with a remotely hosted font?
Short answer: No, you can't
Longer answer: If you have control of the remote server on which the fonts are hosted, i.e. if it's 'yours' and not something like GoogleAPIs then there are ways of tweaking the server (Apache, ngnix &c) to do it. For details see here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11616306/css-font-face-absolute-url-from-external-domain-fonts-not-loading-in-firefox

However you can use the @import rule ...:

### Day ???/100: 06-12-2024

Made some modest progress on the Design System project.

**Thoughts:**
Humility is a useful characteristic in a programmer.

### Day ???/100: 07-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
More work on the Design System project. Colors sorted.

**Thoughts:**
Paring it back to what is actually asked for is hard.
Were I doing this again I would follow the course 'properly' and do things as presented not when my ego saw fit to deign to do them.

### Day ???/100: 11-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Finally completed the Design System project (on Codecademy)


**Thoughts:**
I should have completed it several years ago. I skipped over it because I couldn't get my head around the idea of a Design System when there was no project to design for. Ho hum! Lesson learned.

### Day ???/100: 13-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Structure of Company Home Page sorted, fonts chosen.
I may do a bit more before I turn in.

**Thoughts:**
Playing for a bit without worrying overmuch about anything helped me get a handle on this. It's a simple one-pager just to try out Flexbox. (Codecademy folks seem to love Flexbox and run screaming from Grid but I'm the other way about.)

me: Woohoo! Sometimes it's the tricky ones that give most satisfaction in the end.


### Day ???/100: 15-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
None, kind of a dossing about sort of a day. I may get to plan the current 'project' web page once I get into bed. Pretty minimal, shouldn't take long.

**Thoughts:**
In response to 'How far can I go' (in another place) I posted this:
'As far as your dreams can reach. The only constraints are your effort and your knowledge of self.' Feels like history and I have taken to repeating ourselves.

**Today's Progress**:

### Day ???/100: 18-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Codecademy Responsive Company Home Page project:
sorted out my design system type stuff: colours, fonts and font styles.

**Thoughts:**
I've realised that the front-end side of full-stack isn't where my head is at right now. I don't think I'm much of a designer. Perhaps time will tell a different story

### Day ???/100: 19-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on the Company Home Page Project
Revised the Flexbox lesson


**Pay Forward:**
1. @dorjeman on fCC Discord
re: interview prep 'find the symetric difference'
me: That sounds very 'ouch!'. Well done.

2. @DaniMetroplex on fCC Discord
re: 'Review Algorithmic thinking...'
me: Sounds like everybody but me is grokking algorithms this week. I need to catch up.


### Day ???/100: 20-12-2024
**Today's Progress**:
[Post I should have made yesterday but by the time I got there it wasn't today any more...]
Today's Progress: More work on the current project. Focus on learning rather than doing though some of that too.


**Pay Forward:**
1. @Zino on fCC Discord
re: 'lil js'
me: Doesn't matter how 'lil' so long as there's 'sommat'
[Bristolian for 'something'.]

2. @nekit on fCC Discord
re: lots of good stuff
me: Awesome!




### Day ???/100: 21-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Day off today.


**Pay Forward:**
1. @Canti on fCC Discord
re: poorly ick
me: Sorry to hear that. What is the sickness?
Hope you are better soon, able to get back to coding and to life in general.

2. @sualokin on fCC Discord
re: finished project and contributed a PR on and issue with fCC
me: Well done and well done for contributing.





### Day ???/100: 22-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Completed the Company Webpage project, sort of.

**Thoughts:**
I've let this go on too long. Passing over these projects the first time through was the biggest mistake ever. Lesson learned ... perhaps.


**Pay Forward:**
1. @sualokin on fCC Discord
re: Some Udemy stuff
me: Nice job!

2. @Soniya Sharma on fCC Discord
re: Day One and fCC Cat app
me: Well done and welcome to the challenge. Good luck on your coding journey.



### Day ???/100: 23-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Another day off. Unless you count finishing the Christmas shopping but there wasn't much code involved.


**Thoughts:**
Another lesson learned (re yesterday's reflection) is that trying to do these projects in the learning environment is counter productive. Had I no other way of doing it I would cope better but knowing that I do have a better set up available with just a little bit of work needed is just too frustrating. For the next round (2025 - Round One, 2025/R1/D000/100, starting 7th Day, 4th of 1st Month 2025) I will have a space set aside where I can work comfortably-ish with a 2nd screen attached. 


**Pay Forward:**
1. @nekit on fCC Discord
re: some refactoring
me: rems are super cool. Helps with responsiveness.
And well done for making sense of all that async stuff

2. @Clari on fCC Discord
re: see below
me: WooHoo! Recursion, clever stuff that.


### Day ???/100: 24-12-2024
**Today's Progress**:
Did a (very) little planning and preparation for the next project.


**Thoughts:**
Wishing everyone Season's Greetings and a Happy (Gregorian calendar) New Year.


**Pay Forward:**
1. @wendychen233 on fCC Discord
re: 'plan to do some JS'
me: As one I've-totally-lost-track-of-what-day-I'm-on 100-dayer to another, I hope you managed to get somewhere you were happy with.

2. @Corruuption03 on fCC Discord
re: 'a lot of progress... Scrimba course'
me: K! What's the course?



### Day ???/100: 25-12-2024
**Today's Progress**: 
Day off...


**Pay Forward:**
1. @ReeapR on fCC Discord
re: ' finished ... and very proud of myself.
me: So you should be:-)

2. @Canti on fCC Discord
re: see below
me: Good to hear you're feeling better.
Good to think beyond the programme.


### Day ???/100: 26-12-2024
**Today's Progress**:
Off to bed now but will be redesigning the (Codecademy) Responsive Club Website layout.

**Thoughts:**
Trying to stay off screen for the last part of the day.

### Day ???/100: 28    -12-2024
**Today's non-Progress**:

We went out to buy a mobility scooter and the day went downhill from there.

re: Day 1/100 but doesn't say anything else
me: Welcome to the challenge. What are you working on?

2. @Anjali_Pillai on fCC Discord
re: Day One. '... trouble focusing...' 
me: Good job starting on the challenge. In my experience focus gets better with consistent practice, and sadly wanes when the consistence fades. Ho hum!
