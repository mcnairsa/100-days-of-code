# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 001/100: Seventh Day, 28th of Nineth Month, 2024
**Today's Progress**: Work on Codecademy Challenge Project Website Design System

**Thoughts:** From Day One of Round One: 'It feels good to be starting this for real at last.'

It feels even better to be starting Round One.

**Link to work:** [(https://github.com/mcnairsa/CD-Design-System/

Notes:
After spending some time on putting together an index.html from scratch I found that I had already made a previous start on this. Today's effort is saved as ideas.html. It has some useful thoughts on how I hope to approach this project but is over-ambitions.

Plan for tomorrow:
1. Expand index.html (the original one)
2. Create the CSS
3. Make a plan for the next few projects

I aim to complete the Website Design System project by the end of tomorrow's project work time. It will be quite basic but will meet the requirements set out by Codecademy for the project so I can sign it off and move on.

### Day 002/100: 29-09-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed Animal Fun Facts. With the help of the AI.
It's been a while since I worked on it and I've forgottem most of what it was about

**Thoughts:** 
This feels a lot more solid than Round 0. Quite a lot to do to tidy up the noise and clutter.
Important that I get on top of the learning and memory aspects of this. Especially things like the webpage meta data.

**Link to Work:**
No link as it was on the Cc 

**Pay Forward:**
Cc Circle: Sea 
LinkedIn: Someone who made a 'Frogger' type game - in Python, I think. I looked for it again to record it here and can't find it.


### Day 003/100: 30-09-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Downloaded the 'starting' files for Codecademy's Challenge Project Find Your Hat. Set up local and remote repo for the same.
In the process of which I set up templates for repo README.md files and the LICENSE (sic) files.

**Thoughts:** 
This isn't much of a start and is a departure from what I was planning to do. However, if feels more solid 

**Link to Work:**
https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat
Not much to see yet except for the Codecademy starting code, more to come.

**Pay Forward:**
1. Reply to reply from 'Sea' on Cc's Circle
2. Aditi Byhut on Linked in - 86/100 'Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings'.

**Notes:**
1. In my mind the 100 days falls into two halves of seven weeks each of seven weeks plus two days. My week starts on a 1st Day/Sunday so the 100-day round starts on a 7th Day/Saturday (I started on 28th of the 9th Month/September). This gives me a day of easing myself into the 100 days at the beginning and a day of easing myself out at the end. To help me along I plan to give the weeks a focus. (See below, points (2) & (3).

2. In parallel with the 100 days of coding I am also re-treading the path through Stephen R. Covey's <<Seven Habits of Highly Effective People>>. Each week of the first seven I will focus on one of the 'Habits' This week it is Habit One: Be Proactive. (I may also cycle through the 7 habits, or at least the first 6, on each day of the week. 

3. Possibly in weeks 8 to 14 I will use the book <<7 Languages in 7 Weeks>> as my focus tool. That remains to be seen.


### Day 004/100: 01-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed the Codecademy 'Find Your Hat challenge project

**Thoughts:** 
First time in a long while doing any coding that was more than simply obeying orders to follow a 'project' point by point. Some what. Frustrating how much I had to look up and go back over the relevant lessons but felt good nonetheless.

[Proposal/Plan for the next day

**Link to Work:**
main.js now updated with some of my own work:

https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat

**Intention and expectation for the next day**
Tomorrow, in the spirit of 'Start with the end in mind' (today's 'Habit') I aim to make significant progress with this project if not complete it.

**Pay Forward:**
1. @Asiya Md on LinkedIn
2. @spsinghrathore on Codecademy


### Day 005/100: 02-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed the Find Your Hat game. I have the main game loop in place.

**Thoughts:** 
Moving slowly and taking one step at a time is working. As I come across any aspect of JS that I'm not sure of I am going back to the Codecademy lessons and as a minimum using the practice facility as a refresher.

**Link to Work:**

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Tomorrow I aim to complete this project at least to the minimum specification given.

2. @Abhishek on Cc


### Day 006/100: 03-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
More of a thinking about sort of a day than a coding day.

**Thoughts:** 
Today I find that if I call it programming rather than coding it makes me feel better.

**Link to Work:**
Noting committed today, see above

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Tomorrow I hope to have more focus

I can identify with what you say  

Although I’ve studied the material before in going through the F-S path I’ve not really grasped it. I find that the F-SE modules and he whole of F-SE can be overwhelming. Recently I’ve started searching for the individual courses. Each one has a certificate of achievement and each is only expected to take 3 or 4 hours. That’s with the quiz and the end of lesson project. 

Also it helps me to use the quizzes as a learning resource. I go back over them. If I get less than 100% consistently I use the practice sessions until I feel I have grokked it. 

The most important skill in learning anything is learning how to learn. There’s a useful resource here

Go well

2.To @Rea on fCC'd Discord 100-Days-of-Code channel
Good luck with the journey @Rea

It looks like you're taking very full notes there. I've alwasys had a difficult relationship with note-taking. I'm interested to know what you do with them, how they help you learn.

Bonus: https://community.codecademy.com/u/525664b8 
Anyone interested in build a world changing product? I need data science, Back End,and A.I work? I’m a UX designer so I can handle product direction, UX, and business strategy.

My Post:
Interesting.	

Would you like to share information about your product? In what way will it change the world? How will it make the world a better place for us and future generations?


### Day 007/100: 04-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
I did a small amount of project work but didn't commit anything.
I intended to do more but fell asleep at the wheel so gave up.

**Thoughts:** 
Doing the pay forward is what matters to me most. I put my thoughts in writing and may record them (in summary, the original isn't in an appropriate form for sharing atm) here later.

**Link to Work:**
Nothing commited

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Fail better...


### Day 008/100: 05-10-2025

**Today's Progress**:
Progressed the Find Your Hat Codecademy project

Note: not that I expect anybody to be looking at it but I muffed up the days on the commit messages.

On checking in with the AI (on the Codecademy learning environment) I got this:
It looks like you’re experiencing an ENXIO error, which typically means that the program is trying to access a device that’s unavailable, in this case, /dev/tty. This often occurs in environments where standard input/output is not available, such as certain online coding platforms or during tests. To fix this, you can replace the prompt implementation with a mock input or testing framework suitable for the environment you’re using, or simulate user input in your tests.

Here’s how you can fix line 40 by using a placeholder for user input:

... It looks to me like it's time to take this off-platform.

The changes aren't great but here's the link nonetheless
https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Start working on this locally. I'll still use the Codecademy learning environment because of the feedback I can get from the AI but it feels like time to get a bit more independent of it.


### Day 009/100: 06-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed the Codecademy Find Your Hat challenge project. Not a lot just a little. I have realised that the code needs to be restructured. The game loop should be a method of the class. Mainly I was making minor adjustments. 


**Thoughts:**
This works much better on the local environment than on the platform.

**Link to Work:**
https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat/main.js

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
I now have a better perspective on the Find Your Hat project. I hope to finish it tomorrow.

What to do next
As the title suggest, I'm not to sure what to do next. I'm about to finish the Python 3 course and not sure what to choose next. Do I go for a career path like Full Stack? Or go for an individual language like Java, JavaScript, C# or Swift?


What are you doing this for? Are you hoping to make a career out of it or do you just want to learn as much about IT as possible? In what follows I’ll assume it’s the former.

tl;dr

If you know what you want to achieve google a bit to find the path to that goal and follow it.
If you don’t know, play around with what’s on offer on Codecademy and see what you feel drawn to.

From my previous experience working in IT I would say you are better off extending your knowledge of Python. A successful IT career depends on the right balance of breadth and depth. Breadth is measured in how many languages you know e.g. ‘C’, C++, C#, Java and similar languages or frameworks e.g. React, Vue, Angular. Depth is measured in how well you know any one language or framework. People get more respect for depth of knowledge. Doing 5 introductory courses means you know how to write a for loop or create a class 5 different ways but can’t do much with any language. Doing the next level course (in your case Python?) means you have more to offer.

IT careers are built on skill sets. A skill set usually includes knowledge of a programming language but includes more besides. Most commercial applications use some kind of database. It often includes knowledge of an ‘industry’ like marketing, manufacture, insurance or healthcare. It also often includes specific packages that cater for the needs of those industries. Or if you want to go into, for example Data Science, you would need to be well-versed in libraries that have that focus.

As you’re asking this question I guess you don’t have that kind of focus yet. Taking a breadth-first approach may be more appropriate to you right now. If that’s the case I suggest you try the other languages.

One thing that will stand you in good stead is to actually know how to use your computer. The Codecademy learning environment is great, it’s safe and (usually) comfortable but it’s an unreal world. Learn the command line and how to navigate the file system. Learn to use an editor. Learn how to test the stuff you write for yourself.

And make sure you properly learn stuff. For example, the first 5 to 10 lines or so of a webpage from <head> to </head> are stuff that no web developer is ever likely to write on the job. It’s boilerplate that will come from a template or be generated for you. If I were interviewing though l’d pick the persons who can walk up to the whiteboard and write that stuff without thinking over the one who hasn’t bothered to learn it. To give another example, can that person tell me straight off how the Big O notation works on a simple search vs a binary search. If not why not. Confession time: I couldn’t. That’s why I’m sat in bed typing this rather than being paid to do something I enjoy. It’s also why IT and I parted company over years ago.

Sorry turned into a rant aimed mainly at myself…

Has anyone ever used or heard about the website (www.focusmate.com)?

I’ve used it a lot over the last few years to provide accountability and motivation for all sorts of tasks (including coding) and wanted to share in case it could help others too

My response (after following the link):

Awesome! Thank you:-)

Time taken: approx 1.5 hrs and only one

### Day 010/100: 07-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
More on Find Your Hat. I took a step back, read the rubric properly and re-organised my main game loop into a method of its own. I intended to come back to it but life and family got in the way.
I have also moved off-platform.

**Thoughts:** 
Feels good to have a better grip on the program. Being off-platform feels a lot more grown up. In the back-ground I am working back over some of the concepts in <<The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People>> The first three habits relate to moving from dependence [in this case on the hand-holding of having the learning platform] to independence. Independence is not a goal in itself but a necessary step in the direction of interdependence. Which is what we're all about here, right?

OP: Day 12 in Full-Stack Development: Web App For Asking My Crush Out
Posted: 07-10-2024

I wanted to take a moment to share my learning experience and a fun project I recently completed. While I couldn’t finish the full Codecademy Full Stack Developer course due to financial constraints, I made some amazing progress on my journey as an aspiring developer.

One of my proudest achievements so far is a web application I built to ask my crush out on a date! ...

My response

Awesome idea. Glad to hear it did the trick too:-)

How are you carrying on with the Full-Stack journey if you can't continue on Codecademy? Have you found freeCodeCamp.org's curriculum? Or The Odin Project? I recently discovered that IBM have a Full-Stack Engineer Certification as well and I think that may be free. Also (sorry Codecademy Sales:-) you can do quite a lot of F-SE for free if you take the individual courses.

That's a really comprehensive README.md, btw. It puts any and all of mine to shame!

That's a great achievement. More pwoer to your finger tips.

Are you following the Codecademy Full-Stack curriculum? If so how far into are you? If not what are you following?


### Day 011/100: 08-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed Find Your Hat. More work on the game engine.


**Thoughts:**
I've come up against a less than perfect understanding of updating elements withing a multidimensional array (JS). Time to go back to learning-mode.

**Link to Work:**

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed Codecademy off-platform pjoject Tea Cozy
Involves doing battle with Flexbox which I haven't looked at in mohths. Pretty rusty on CSS in general tbh.
Got back into that headspace and made progress with the contacts and footer sections.


**Thoughts:** 
This is a project that folks on the Full-Stack group on Codecademy were asking for help with. I feels like I might be able to shed some light on it for people who are still in the fog.

Responding to Intro and '1961' + ZX81 experience
Me: Hey   !

You beat me by one model. My first was the ZXSpectrum. I dabbled in various languages. Basic, Pascal, C, possibly Fortran and Lisp and managed to learn zero programming from any of it. My crowning achievement was to set the text colour to black before I’d thought to set the background colour to something other than black … oops! I think I pulled the plug and vowed never to do anything quite so idiotic ever again. A vow soon broken, no doubt.

Keep it up.

If I were to give advice to anyone starting out on this path, I would say:

1. think about the time you can commit to this

2. think about how long you want to give it before you feel you have got to where you have enough confidence and independence to be able to make your own self-directed projects

3. … and then find a path that will get you there in your timeframe.

Full-Stack may be what you want if you have the time and want a well-rounded level of knowledge. Or you might want to focus in on either Front-End or Back-End. The front-end is great for design and making pretty things. Back-End is more pointy-headed. There’s pleny of scope in both for point-headedness and prettiness though.

There again maybe Python, Data Science  and all things Data is your thing.

Not sure if you were asking for advice but you got it anyway, my Bad!

Go well!

btw:  I have seniority over you in years if not in tech, 1958 here
PPS: If you’re into Data look at MongoDB. You may have already but you didn’t mention it.

re: Day 2 ' does ... count'
