# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 001/100: Seventh Day, 28th of Nineth Month, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Work on Codecademy Challenge Project Website Design System

**Thoughts:** From Day One of Round One: 'It feels good to be starting this for real at last.'

It feels even better to be starting Round One.

**Link to work:** [(https://github.com/mcnairsa/CD-Design-System/

Notes:
After spending some time on putting together an index.html from scratch I found that I had already made a previous start on this. Today's effort is saved as ideas.html. It has some useful thoughts on how I hope to approach this project but is over-ambitions.

Plan for tomorrow:
1. Expand index.html (the original one)
2. Create the CSS
3. Make a plan for the next few projects

I aim to complete the Website Design System project by the end of tomorrow's project work time. It will be quite basic but will meet the requirements set out by Codecademy for the project so I can sign it off and move on.

### Day 002/100: 29-09-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed Animal Fun Facts. With the help of the AI.
It's been a while since I worked on it and I've forgottem most of what it was about

**Thoughts:** 
This feels a lot more solid than Round 0. Quite a lot to do to tidy up the noise and clutter.
Important that I get on top of the learning and memory aspects of this. Especially things like the webpage meta data.

**Link to Work:**
No link as it was on the Cc 

**Pay Forward:**
Cc Circle: Sea 
LinkedIn: Someone who made a 'Frogger' type game - in Python, I think. I looked for it again to record it here and can't find it.


### Day 003/100: 30-09-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Downloaded the 'starting' files for Codecademy's Challenge Project Find Your Hat. Set up local and remote repo for the same.
In the process of which I set up templates for repo README.md files and the LICENSE (sic) files.

**Thoughts:** 
This isn't much of a start and is a departure from what I was planning to do. However, if feels more solid

Not much to see yet except for the Codecademy starting code, more to come.

**Pay Forward:**
1. Reply to reply from 'Sea' on Cc's Circle
2. Aditi Byhut on Linked in - 86/100 'Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings'.

**Notes:**
1. In my mind the 100 days falls into two halves of seven weeks each of seven weeks plus two days. My week starts on a 1st Day/Sunday so the 100-day round starts on a 7th Day/Saturday (I started on 28th of the 9th Month/September). This gives me a day of easing myself into the 100 days at the beginning and a day of easing myself out at the end. To help me along I plan to give the weeks a focus. (See below, points (2) & (3).

2. In parallel with the 100 days of coding I am also re-treading the path through Stephen R. Covey's <<Seven Habits of Highly Effective People>>. Each week of the first seven I will focus on one of the 'Habits' This week it is Habit One: Be Proactive. (I may also cycle through the 7 habits, or at least the first 6, on each day of the week. 

3. Possibly in weeks 8 to 14 I will use the book <<7 Languages in 7 Weeks>> as my focus tool. That remains to be seen.


### Day 004/100: 01-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed the Codecademy 'Find Your Hat challenge project

**Thoughts:** 
First time in a long while doing any coding that was more than simply obeying orders to follow a 'project' point by point. Some what. Frustrating how much I had to look up and go back over the relevant lessons but felt good nonetheless.

[Proposal/Plan for the next day

**Link to Work:**
main.js now updated with some of my own work:

https://github.com/mcnairsa/CP-Find-Your-Hat

**Intention and expectation for the next day**
Tomorrow, in the spirit of 'Start with the end in mind' (today's 'Habit') I aim to make significant progress with this project if not complete it.

**Pay Forward:**
1. @Asiya Md on LinkedIn
2. @spsinghrathore on Codecademy


### Day 005/100: 02-10-2024

**Today's Progress**: 
Progressed the Find Your Hat game. I have the main game loop in place.

**Thoughts:** 
Moving slowly and taking one step at a time is working. As I come across any aspect of JS that I'm not sure of I am going back to the Codecademy lessons and as a minimum using the practice facility as a refresher.

**Link to Work:**

**Intention and expectation for tomorrow:**
Tomorrow I aim to complete this project at least to the minimum specification given.

**Pay Forward:**
1. @Kayla Arnold on Cc
2. @Abhishek on Cc

I can identify with what you say  

Although I’ve studied the material before in going through the F-S path I’ve not really grasped it. I find that the F-SE modules and he whole of F-SE can be overwhelming. Recently I’ve started searching for the individual courses. Each one has a certificate of achievement and each is only expected to take 3 or 4 hours. That’s with the quiz and the end of lesson project. 

Also it helps me to use the quizzes as a learning resource. I go back over them. If I get less than 100% consistently I use the practice sessions until I feel I have grokked it. 

The most important skill in learning anything is learning how to learn. There’s a useful resource here

Go well

Good luck with the journey @Rea

It looks like you're taking very full notes there. I've alwasys had a difficult relationship with note-taking. I'm interested to know what you do with them, how they help you learn.

Bonus: https://community.codecademy.com/u/525664b8 
Anyone interested in build a world changing product? I need data science, Back End,and A.I work? I’m a UX designer so I can handle product direction, UX, and business strategy.

My Post:
Interesting.

Would you like to share information about your product? In what way will it change the world? How will it make the world a better place for us and future generations?
