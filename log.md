# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 001/100: Seventh Day, 28th of Nineth Month, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Work on Codecademy Challenge Project Website Design System

**Thoughts:** From Day One of Round One: 'It feels good to be starting this for real at last.'

It feels even better to be starting Round One.

Notes:
After spending some time on putting together an index.html from scratch I found that I had already made a previous start on this. Today's effort is saved as ideas.html. It has some useful thoughts on how I hope to approach this project but is over-ambitions.

Plan for tomorrow:
1. Expand index.html (the original one)
2. Create the CSS
3. Make a plan for the next few projects

I aim to complete the Website Design System project by the end of tomorrow's project work time. It will be quite basic but will meet the requirements set out by Codecademy for the project so I can sign it off and move on.
